                <br>
                Offer Bright Career Options- In addition to other branches that AI has developed, Machine Learning is
                one such branch that brings many career options that one might not know.

                Enables More Functions- Artificial Intelligence course is always referred to as computer systems that
                are built to mimic human intelligence. It is quite helpful because it enables the web- developers to
                perform tasks like recognition of images, speech, and patterns as well as informing subtle decisions.
                This is the reason why AI can do tasks faster and more accurately than human beings.
                <br>
                <br>

                Relevant Usage- From the survey, it has been found that five out of six Americans in one way or another
                use navigation apps, streaming services, smartphone personal assistants, ride-sharing apps, as well as
                smartphone devices.
                <br>
                <br>

                Money-saving task- AI’s use is specifically used to schedule trains, accessing business risk-related
                tasks, and in predicting maintenance, improvises energy efficiency among many other types of
                money-saving tasks.
            </p>
            <br>
            <H2>      Why is learning AI important?</H2>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">

                Linked with Automation- AI is moreover referred to as one part where one wants to link it with
                automation and automation has become a hot topic because of the potential job loss.
                <br><br>
                Generation of More Revenues- According to the sources it has been revealed by the experts that AI will
                generate more than 23 million jobs by the year 2030. Specific areas where the AI jobs would be created
                are the fields linked to programming, testing, support, and maintenance and AI Intelligence Architect is
                one such particular job that one should definitely know.
                <br><br>
                Thus earning a certification in AI will not only fuel your career but will also enable you to get the

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Leads to Discovery of New Patterns- It is defined as another subset of
                AI and with the help of Machine Learning, computers are programmed in the manner that web developers can
                learn something new by discovering patterns and also in gaining insights from the data. Thus, in
                general, there are two types of learning like supervised and unsupervised learning.
                <br>
                <br>
                Offers In-Depth Learning - Since Machine Learning is recalled as the subset of AI, one can expect that
                it will have the subsets within the domain of Machine Learning that includes neural networks, natural
                language processing (NLP), and deep learning too. Moreover, each of these subsets is known for offering
                an opportunity for web developers to specialize in the career field that they only prefer to know.
                <br>
                <br>

                Huge Demand by Professionals- Machine learning is one such programming language that is rapidly
                developed in all kinds of industries by creating a huge demand for skilled professionals. The market for
                machine learning is expected to grow beyond USD 8.81 billion by 2022.
                <br>
                <br>
                Drives More Results-The applications formed by machine learning are used for analyzing the data, data
                mining, and recognizing the pattern. On the other end, the Machine Learning platform lends power to
                web-driven results and in detecting real-time ads as well as network intrusion detection.

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Automates Jobs- Just like AI and Machine learning, Robotic Process
                Automation is defined as another technology that automates several jobs. It is the use of software to
                automate business processes like interpreting applications, processing transactions, dealing with data,
                and even reporting to emails. The technology of RPA includes automation of repetitive tasks that are
                often used by people.
                <br>
                <br>
                Generates More Activities- Moreover, these are not just the menial tasks of the low-paid worker and it
                can generate more than 45% of the activities that can be easily automated and it includes the work of
                financial managers, doctors as well as CFOs.
                <br>
                <br>

                Impacted Many Lives- It has been found by Forrester Research estimates that RPA automation will threaten
                the livelihood of more than 230 million or knowledge workers by impacting the workforce of around 9% of
                people around the globe.
                <br>
                <br>

                High Demand for Automation-It has been found out by McKinsey that less than 5% of the occupations can be
                automated whereas more than 60% of the occupations can be automated partially.
                <br>
                <br>

                Plenty of Opportunities- If you are an IT professional who is looking for a brighter future and tries to
                understand the technological trends then RPA offers plenty of career opportunities that include
                developers, project managers, business analysts, solution architects, and consultants too.
                <br>
                <br>

                It has been found by SimplyHired.com that the average RPA salary is estimated to be near around USD
                1,41,000 annually. If you are eager to learn more about RPA then enrolling in the certifications of the
                Robotic Process Automation course should be your next step.

                to dominate the market. This is the reason why the adoption of cloud computing has become a major trend
                and is known as the migration cloud solution. Thus, it no longer remains the emerging technology.
                <br><br>
                Helps in Capturing the Data-Since- the quantity of data that we are dealing with continues to increase
                and one has realized the shortcomings of cloud computing in some other situations. This is the type of
                computing that is designed to help people solve their problems bypassing the latency caused by cloud
                computing and attaining the data to the data center for processing.
                <br><br>
                Process Time-sensitive Data- Probably this is the reason why edge computing is used to process
                time-sensitive data in remote locations with limited or no connectivity to the centralized locations.
                <br><br>
                Arise in Marketing- In similar types of situations, edge-computing enacts the role of mini-data centers
                and it is used for the increasing use of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. By the year 2022, there
                are chances that the cloud-computing market will reach beyond USD 6.72 billion.

                control of the data.
                <br><br>
                Enhances Trust- Thus with the help of block-chain, one cannot trust the third party to oversee or even
                validate the transactions and thus this is referred to as the blockchain's major importance.
                <br><br>
